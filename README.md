# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Lousie is a up and coming playwright who is looking to start crowdfunding campaign to held her play, "Fever". Using Excel formulas, pivot tables and charts, we analyzed Kickstarter data to gain insights that would help Lousie determine the parameters for her kickstarter campaign to support the production of her play. Through our analysis, we hope to understand what aspects of a campaign make it more likely to succeed. 
## Analysis and Challenges
##### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date Results
In our analaysis, we looked at outcome trends based on the launch data of kickstarter campaigns for the parent category theather. Our data for this information spanned across several years, so in order to ensure we could review the data by year, we used the =YEARS() excel formula which pulls out the year from Date Created field in our raw data and allowed us to insert a new column. The the addition of this data, we created a pivot table to view performance by month broken out by successful, failed, or canceled. There were a handful of "live" campaigns but these were not included in our analysis because they would not help us understand the coorelation between outcomes and start dates. 
##### Outcomes Based on Goals Analysis
In addition to review performance by launch dates, we also reviewed outcomes based on the goals in which we broke those out into brackets by every $5,000 goal increment as well as any goal less than $1,000. In this analysis, it is important to keep in mind how you want to use your greater and less than criteria when writing the goal. In our formula, we used =COUNTIFS function so that it would only count a cell if all the criteria were met. When writing this formula, you had to ensure you correctly wrote out the greater than or equal to ">=" and the less than "<" and updated them for each row properly. This was time consuming and I feel there is likely a more efficient way to write the formula. Additionally, you'll want to use anchors when dragging the formula from the Number Successful column to Number Failed to ensure you main the correct column for counting and criteria. If you do, then you can streamline the Failed and Canceled formulas by simply doing a 'find and replace' to change successful with failed or canceled. Having anchors for percentage columns also helped to ensure you always compared it to Column E but allowed the row numbers to change when pulling the formula to other cells.
## Results
Based on our analysis, we can come to two conclusions on the data. Firt, the best month for a theather KickStarter campaign to launch would be in May, followed by June. Secondly, you are more likely to have a successful campaign, if your goal amount is $5000 or less.
